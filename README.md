Code repository for the study "Augmented Renal Clearance is Associated with Lower Mortality in Sepsis". Analyzes 41,787 sepsis patients without AKI from 5 international ICU cohorts (MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-III, eICU, AUMC, CMAISE). Code implements multivariate regression, PSM, meta-analysis, and transcriptomic (RNA-seq/Olink) analysis. Key finding: ARC (eGFR>130 mL/min) independently associates with lower in-hospital mortality (OR=0.69) and has unique molecular signatures. Built with statistical and bioinformatics tools.
